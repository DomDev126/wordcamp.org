	Note: This has to be accessed via https://central.wordcamp.org/wp-content/miscellaneous/active-groups-map/index.html to avoid various restrictions.

	### todo
		some meetups, like seattle and NYC are missing, maybe b/c the coordinates overlap too closely and google is filtering them out?
			maybe just coincidence and some meetup groups that don't have wordcamps are missing too?

	### process to build KML file:
		warning that you won't see any changes until you deploy them to production, b/c google has to access the file from their servers

		#### wordcamps
		most wordcamps have to have a meetup first, but regional camps can be in cities that don't have a meetup, and camps, so still need to include camps in addition to meetups.
		export wordcamps to csv from https://central.wordcamp.org/wp-admin/index.php?page=wordcamp-reports&report=wordcamp-details
			restrict export to camps from the past 12 months, since this map is of "active" events
			need name, url, and coordinate fields
		take into libreoffice and use "text to columns" feature to split coordinates into latitude and longitude columns, save that as CSV
		you'll also need to trim the `'` character from the begining of cells that contain negative latitudes.
			that's added to the csv for security reasons, but will mess up the KML if it's not removed
			doing a search/replace for `<coordinates>'` and `,'-` is a good way to get rid of it.
		upload CSV to http://convertcsv.com/csv-to-kml.htm, convert to KML
			use url as description
			make sure you get latitude and longitude in the right order. KML wants longitude first, then latitude.
		edit groups.kml and delete all the existing <placemark> entries under the `WordCamp` <folder>
		then paste the new <Placemark> entries into that folder
			make sure you don't paste in other tags from the file, like <kml>, <document>, etc
			make sure you only overwrite wordcamps, not meetups, and that they get pasted into the WordCamp <folder>

		#### meetups
		export meetsup to csv from https://central.wordcamp.org/wp-admin/index.php?page=wordcamp-reports&report=meetup-groups
			select the past 12 months
		remove columns except name, url, latitude, longitude
		repeat wordpress process to add to convert to KML and add to groups.kml


		#### finish
		commit and deploy the files to production, you won't be able to see any changes until this happens
			this is because google accesses the KML from their end and won't see changes on your sandbox


	### potential process improvements if use this again in future
		could have a script that generates the exact KML we want, instead of bothering with the manual conversion
	 	don't need to combine them, can have multiple kmllayers, so just setup one file for each layer. it's fine to have one script for wordcamps and another for meetups
		make urls in descriptions links
		maybe setup <extendeddata> like older versions -- https://github.com/WordPress/wordcamp.org/blob/f99f6100aa6f7b7612e442dd74efd5171fa2f777/public_html/wp-content/miscellaneous/active-groups-map/groups.kml ?

	### misc
		potentially interesting to use this to see which areas don't have a meetup within driving distance, and focus some efforts there, to make sure everyone in the world has access to a meetup
